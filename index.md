## [GPU Accelerated Particle System](GPU Accelerated Particle System)
> Year 2 Student Project / Solo Programmer / 8 weeks

In this project all the particles are stored and updated entirely on the GPU. I learned a lot about how to wrote code and implement algorithms for compute shaders. I even wrote an article on how to implement [parallel prefix sum](/2024/04/12/parallel-prefix-sum).

## Nature Sim Engine
### procedurally generated nature scene
>Year 2 Student Project / Team of 5 / Programmer / 8 weeks

![Blossom Screen Shot](assets/flowers.png)For this project I implemented vertex displacement to simulate vegetation moving in the wind. I also did some work for prop placement including generating transforms that are flush with the tessellated terrain and some simple UI stuff.
